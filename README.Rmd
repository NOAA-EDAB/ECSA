# ECSA

Ecosystem Context for Stock Advice (ECSA) reports are intended to span a range of potential factors affecting the productivity and distribution of a specific fish stock, including: surface and bottom temperature and salinity, chlorophyll concentrations, indices of habitat, diet composition, and abundance of key zooplankton prey of larval and adult fish. These factors can be used to qualitatively inform the interpretation of population status and/or quantitatively to improve model responsiveness to ecosystem factors. The range and complexity of ecosystem data makes it unlikely to find the most relevant and comprehensive factor variables with a first evaluation; this process will require an iterative approach of evaluation and feedback. Additional indices can be included to address the needs of the working group.

ECSA reports have been generated for the following stocks:
```{r ECSA-reports}
## Get list of docs
ecsa_files <- list.files("docs/", pattern = "ECSA_(.*).html")

## Get report name and clean it up
ecsa_name <- gsub("ECSA_(.*).html", "\\1", ecsa_files)
ecsa_name <- gsub("-", " ", ecsa_name)
ecsa_name <- gsub("atlantic", "Atlantic", ecsa_name)

## Create data.frame with hyperlink
ecsa_table <- data.frame("Report" = sprintf('<a href="https://noaa-edab.github.io/ECSA/%s" target="_blank">%s</a>',
                         ecsa_files,
                         ecsa_name))

knitr::kable(ecsa_table)
```

## Installation

``` {r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("noaa-edab/ecsa")
```

## Example

Code used in ECSA and template to produce contextual ecosystem reports for stock assessment.
```{r example, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
create_template(survdat_name = "SMOOTH DOGFISH", overwrite = F, output_dir = getwd())
```
```{r dog-pic, out.width='32.8%', fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/ECSA_smooth-dogfish.png")
```
